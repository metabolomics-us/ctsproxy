# AngularBreakpoint

##### Add responsive design awareness to your angular templates

Angular Breakpoint listens for media query changes and updates the global scope of your app with the active breakpoint.

### Demo

[Angular Breakpoint Demo](http://codepen.io/alexandercastillo/pen/rOdKwJ)


### Quick Start

Install and manage with [jspm](http://jspm.io) or [Bower](http://bower.io). A [CDN](http://cdnjs.com/libraries/angular-breakpoint) is also provided by cdnjs.com

``` bash
$ jspm install angular-breakpoint
```

``` bash
$ bower install angular-breakpoint
```

1) Include the required JavaScript libraries in your `index.html` (ngRoute and UI Router are optional). 

``` html
<script src="/libs/angularjs/1.5.6/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="/libs/angular-breakpoint/angular-breakpoint.min.js"></script>
```

2) Add `ngBreakpoint` as a dependency in your app.

``` js
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngBreakpoint']);
```

### Examples

This module can be used by adding the `breakpoint` directive to your main template. 

```html
<html ng-app="myApp" breakpoint>
```

Then, default or custom breakpoints will be accessible in your templates. The following example illustrates how a DOM element can only be visible on small screens.

```html
<nav ng-if="breakpoint.sm">
  ...
</nav>
```

In the same way, it can be used in other directives like `ng-class`.

```html
<body ng-class="{ 'mobile': breakpoint.sm, 'tablet': breakpoint.md, 'desktop': breakpoint.lg }">
  ...
</body>
```

See [demo](http://codepen.io/alexandercastillo/pen/rOdKwJ) for more information.


### Default Breakpoints

```js
{
  xs: '(max-width: 480px)', // extra small screens
  sm: '(min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px)', // small screens
  md: '(min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 991px)', // medium screens
  lg: '(min-width: 992px)' // large screens
}
```

### Configuring custom breakpoints

You can set custom breakpoints via `$breakpointProvider` during the `config` phase of your app.

``` js
myApp.config(function($breakpointProvider) {

  $breakpointProvider.set({
    appleWatch: '(max-device-width: 42mm) and (min-device-width: 38mm)',
    mobile: 'handheld and (max-width: 768px)',
    tablet: 'handheld and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1190px)',
    desktop: '(min-width: 1191x) and (max-width: 1400px)',
    kiosk: '(min-width: 1401px) and (max-width: 1800px) and (min-aspect-ratio: 4/3)',
    tv: 'tv and (scan: progressive)'
  });

});
```

### Support

AngularBreakpoint is fully supported by AngularJS 1.3+
